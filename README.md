# Requirements
## Julia
Download and setup instructions for Julia at the Julia website: http://julialang.org/

### JuMP
JuMP is an optimization package for Julia which allows users to write readable optimization code and automatically interfaces with solvers. Download and setup instructions for JuMP at the JuMP website: http://jump.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

You will need the Cbc and Ipopt solvers for the optimization code to run. Details on their installation is also on the JuMP website (it's very easy).
